Day-to-Day Activities as a DevOps Engineer
Morning (9:00 AM – 12:00 PM)
1. CI/CD Pipeline Management (1–2 hours)

Monitor and review existing Jenkins pipelines for any issues or failures.
Debug and fix errors in pipelines by collaborating with development teams.
Identify opportunities to improve pipeline performance (e.g., reduce build times).
Create or modify Jenkins pipelines to integrate new applications or services.
2. Version Control Management (30 minutes)

Manage Git repositories by enforcing branching strategies (e.g., feature, release, hotfix branches).
Merge pull requests after code review, ensuring proper commit messages and code quality.
Assist developers in resolving merge conflicts during code integration.
3. Cross-Functional Collaboration (30 minutes)

Attend daily stand-ups to stay aligned with the development and QA teams.
Coordinate with QA for pipeline enhancements (e.g., adding automated tests).
Discuss deployment schedules or environment-related issues with the operations team.
Afternoon (12:30 PM – 4:00 PM)
4. Cloud Infrastructure Management & Automation (2 hours)

Use Terraform to manage infrastructure as code:
Write or update Terraform scripts for provisioning resources (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS, VPC, EKS).
Test infrastructure changes in a non-production environment.
Plan and execute infrastructure changes after peer review.
Automate infrastructure setup using Ansible playbooks:
Write playbooks for configuring servers or deploying applications.
Test new Ansible playbooks in a local environment before running them on production.
5. Proactive System Monitoring (1 hour)

Review CloudWatch or Prometheus dashboards to monitor system performance and availability.
Set up or update alerts for critical metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory, request latency).
Investigate alerts received during the day and implement fixes as required.
Ensure that SLIs and SLOs are defined and met for critical services.
Evening (4:00 PM – 6:00 PM)
6. Security Integration (1 hour)

Review CI/CD pipelines for security vulnerabilities and improve them using tools like SonarQube or security scanners.
Ensure that secrets and sensitive information are managed securely using tools like AWS Secrets Manager or Vault.
Update or implement automated security checks within the pipelines.
Work on integrating DevSecOps practices into the deployment process.
7. Scripting and Automation (1 hour)

Write shell or Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks (e.g., log rotation, backup automation, resource cleanup).
Enhance existing scripts by adding error handling, logging, and notifications.
Test and document the scripts for future use.
End of Day (6:00 PM – 7:00 PM)
8. Learning & Industry Trends (1 hour)

Read technical blogs or attend webinars on emerging DevOps tools and practices (e.g., new features in Kubernetes, CloudFormation best practices).
Explore hands-on labs for AWS CloudFormation and practice writing templates for common use cases.
Continue learning Linux and shell scripting by solving small tasks or challenges.
Work on advanced Ansible tasks, such as writing dynamic inventories or using Ansible Vault.
Weekly/Recurring Tasks
Sprint Planning & Retrospective (Weekly)
Participate in sprint planning to discuss new tasks and goals. Review the completed tasks during the retrospective and suggest improvements.

Code & Pipeline Audits (Bi-weekly)
Conduct audits of Git repositories and CI/CD pipelines to ensure best practices are followed.

Backup & Disaster Recovery Drills (Monthly)
Run disaster recovery drills by simulating failures and verifying the ability to restore services from backups.

Security Review & Penetration Testing (Quarterly)
Collaborate with the security team to review the application and infrastructure security posture.
