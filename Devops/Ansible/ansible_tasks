# Task:
Title: Set Up an Apache Web Server using Ansible
Description:
Create an Ansible playbook to set up an Apache web server on a remote machine. Ensure that:

Apache is installed.
The service is enabled and running.
A custom HTML page is deployed at /var/www/html/index.html.
The firewall allows HTTP traffic (port 80).
Test the setup by accessing the webpage from your browser.

Priority: Medium
Acceptance Criteria:

Playbook runs successfully without errors.
Accessing the server's IP in a browser shows the custom HTML page.

 ---
- name: Set up Apache Web Server
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Ensure Apache service is started and enabled
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Deploy custom HTML page
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        content: |
          <html>
          <head>
              <title>Welcome to Apache Server</title>
          </head>
          <body>
              <h1>Hello! This is a custom Apache web page deployed using Ansible.</h1>
          </body>
          </html>
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
        mode: '0644'

    - name: Allow HTTP traffic in firewall
      ansible.builtin.firewalld:
        port: 80/tcp
        permanent: yes
        state: enabled
      notify: restart firewalld

  handlers:
    - name: restart firewalld
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: firewalld
        state: restarted
Explanation:
Install Apache:
Installs the httpd package on the target machine.

Start and Enable Apache:
Ensures that the Apache service is running and will start on boot.

Deploy Custom HTML Page:
Creates an index.html file with a custom HTML content at /var/www/html/.

Allow HTTP Traffic:
Opens port 80 in the firewall to allow HTTP traffic. The handler restarts the firewall to apply changes.

How to Run the Playbook:
Ensure your inventory file has the target machine(s) listed under all.
Run the playbook with:

ansible-playbook -i inventory_file_name playbook_name.yml

# Task 1: Create a File on a Remote Machine
Title: Create a file using Ansible
Description:
Write an Ansible playbook to create a file named ansible_basic.txt in the /tmp directory on a remote machine. The file should contain the text:
"This is my first Ansible task!"

Priority: Low
Acceptance Criteria:


The playbook runs without errors.
The file /tmp/ansible_basic.txt is created on the remote machine with the correct content.

Steps to Complete the Task:
Set up your inventory file:
An inventory file lists the remote machine(s) where you want to run the playbook. Here's an example of an inventory file (inventory.ini):


[myservers]
remote_host ansible_host=your_remote_ip ansible_user=your_username ansible_ssh_private_key_file=path_to_ssh_key
Replace your_remote_ip, your_username, and path_to_ssh_key with the actual values for your setup.

Create the Ansible playbook:
Here's a simple Ansible playbook (create_file.yml) for the task:

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Basic Ansible Task - Create a file
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Create a file with custom content
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        content: "This is my first Ansible task!"
        dest: /tmp/ansible_basic.txt
        mode: '0644'
        
Explanation:

hosts: all means the playbook will run on all hosts listed in your inventory.
become: yes ensures the task runs with elevated privileges (required for writing to /tmp).
The ansible.builtin.copy module is used to create the file with the specified content.
dest: /tmp/ansible_basic.txt specifies the location where the file will be created.
mode: '0644' sets the file's permissions (readable by everyone, writable by the owner).
Run the playbook:
Use the following command to run your playbook:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini create_file.yml
Expected Outcome:
The playbook should run without errors.
A file named ansible_basic.txt will be created in the /tmp directory on the remote machine.
The file should contain the text: "This is my first Ansible task!"
