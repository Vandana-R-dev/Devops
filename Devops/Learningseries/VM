Day-3 (Virtual Machine)

1. # What is a Server?
A server is a computer that provides services, data, or resources to other computers (called clients) over a network. It can store files, run applications, and host websites.

2. # What is a VM (Virtual Machine)?
A VM is software that acts like a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a real machine, but it shares the physical hardware with other VMs.

3. # What is a Hypervisor?
A hypervisor is software that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine by managing the hardware resources like CPU, memory, and storage.
Some of the popular hypervisors are VMware

4. # Difference between Physical and Virtual Machine
Physical Machine	Virtual Machine
Real hardware (CPU, memory)	Virtual hardware (software-based)
Runs directly on hardware	Runs on top of a hypervisor
Cannot be easily copied or moved	Can be easily cloned and moved
High cost	Cost-effective (less hardware needed)
5. # Advantages of Virtual Machines
Cost-effective – Saves money by reducing the need for physical hardware.
Easy to manage – VMs can be quickly created, deleted, or cloned.
Efficient use of resources – Multiple VMs can run on a single physical machine.
Isolation – Each VM is isolated, so issues in one VM don’t affect others.
Portability – VMs can be easily moved between different servers.

**Day-4**
To automate process in AWS we can use:
Aws CLi
AWS API(python have boto3)
AWS CFT
Terraform
AWS CDk(cloud development kit)

# Aws CLi
AWS cli menas we should download from internet and install it.
After installation if we give aws version in command prompt we get everything.
